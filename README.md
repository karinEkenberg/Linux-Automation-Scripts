# Security and Automation Scripts
This repository contains a collection of personal Bash scripts developed during my IT Security Engineering studies.

## Purpose
The scripts are designed to:
- Automate system maintenance and disk cleanup.
- Monitor system health and network status.
- Improve workflow efficiency in a Linux environment.

## Getting Started
To use any script in this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the script has execution permissions:
   `chmod +x <script_name>.sh`
3. Run the script:
   `./<script_name>.sh`

## Green IT Note
These scripts are designed to be lightweight and minimize system resource usage. Regular use of the maintenance scripts helps extend hardware lifespan and reduce energy consumption by keeping the OS clean.

## Security Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational purposes within the scope of my IT security training. Always review the code before running it on a production system.
